# hello-world
lets get it!
Allow me to re-introduce myself!
The goal of me learning to code and program is primarily to trade stocks, options and other securities more efficiently through algorithmic trading. 
My main man Billy will be accompanying me on this journey.
I believe we may need more recruits...
Is this even a commit? 
  Sooo, your telling me that a commit is simply any changes to my code? And my typing may be getting just a wee bit better...
